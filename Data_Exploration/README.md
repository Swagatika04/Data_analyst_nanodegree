#### **Introduction**

In this project we will analyze this dataset whis has information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and it focuses on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row.

- &#39;ScheduledDay&#39; tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment.
- &#39;Neighborhood&#39; indicates the location of the hospital.
- &#39;Scholarship&#39; indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Fam√≠lia.
- &#39;No-show&#39;: It says &#39;No&#39; if the patient showed up to their appointment, and &#39;Yes&#39; if they did not show up.

#### **We will look at the following questions when we will explore the data**

- Does Gender play a role in showing up for appointment?
- Does the Receiving SMS effect appointment show up?
- Are there Neighbourhood&#39;s where Appointment show up is high?
- Does scholarship effect appointment show up?
- Does the waiting time and Age effect the Appointent Show up ?
