## Data Visualization Project

**Ford GoBike data**

This dataset includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area for the month of January.

**Data Source** :  The Datasource for this project is taken from 2017 Ford goBike  https://www.fordgobike.com/systemdata . The dataset has the following parameters:

**Column Name**

bike\_id

duration\_sec

end\_station\_id

end\_station\_latitude

end\_station\_longitude

end\_station\_name

end\_time

start\_station\_id

start\_station\_latitude

start\_station\_longitude

start\_station\_name

start\_time

user\_type

member\_gender

member\_birth\_year

**Steps taken  **

• Accessing data

• Cleaning data

• Univariate Data Analysis

• Bivariate Data Analysis

• Multivariate Data Analysis

• Conclusions

**Questions to be answered:**

• What is the average duration of trips?

• Does age have any effect on the duration/number of trips?

• What is the impact or dependency of the above insights on whether a user is a subscriber or a customer?

• Is there any correlation between age and the duration of trips?

• Does gender play any role in the duration/number of trips between different age groups?

**Conclusions**

• Most people like to go for short trips of about 10 mins.

• With Increasing age the duration of trip decreases, as it is expected.

• Between 18- 29 and 30-39 the trip durations and the number of trips is higher.

• In general members are more likely to not share their trip data. Also, more Males share their data than Females.

• Customers in almost all age groups have longer trip durations than subscribers.

• The only exception being between the ages 70-79 where subscribers have slightly higher trip duration. • In almost all age groups Females have longer Trip duration&#39;s than males. The exception being in 80 +.
